**PAH**
---
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: From Metabolism to Lung Cancer (https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/145/1/5/1627571)
> PAH transformation to carcinogenic metabolites involves 
"metabolic enzymes and 3 major pathways CYP1A1/1B1 and epoxide hydrolase pathway (CYP/EH pathway), CYP peroxidase pathway, and aldo-keto reductases pathway (AKR pathway)"
and PAH metabolites, often metabolized by CYP, may react with DNA to produce DNA adducts. 
DNA-reactive metabolites
