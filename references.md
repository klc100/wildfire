Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: From Metabolism to Lung Cancer  
(https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/145/1/5/1627571)  
- PAH transformation to carcinogenic metabolites involves  
- "metabolic enzymes and 3 major pathways CYP1A1/1B1 and epoxide hydrolase pathway (CYP/EH pathway), CYP peroxidase pathway, and aldo-keto reductases pathway (AKR pathway)"  
- PAH metabolites, often metabolized by CYP, may react with DNA to produce DNA adducts.  
- DNA-reactive metabolites

Do 16 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Represent PAH Air Toxicity?  
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5634701/)  
PMID: 29051449  
- gas-phase PAHs (mainly low molecular weight PAHs) contribute to toxicity  
- "Gas-particle partitioning of semi-volatile compounds shifts to the gas phase at higher temperature, which explains the stronger contribution of gas-phase PAHs during summer months of this project."

(https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.libraries.rutgers.edu/pmc/articles/PMC4631546/)  
- Upregulation (in blood/pulmonary): IL-6, IL-1beta, MIP-1alpha, GM-CSF 

**Wood Smoke Particle**

Wildfire smoke exposure is associated with decreased methylation of the PDL2 gene  
(https://www.jimmunol.org/content/204/1_Supplement/146.17.abstract)  
- T cell response downregulated from decreased PDL2 gene methylation

Wood Smoke Particle Sequesters Cell Iron to Impact a Biological Effect  
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4838017/)  
PMID:26462088
- ferruginous bodies formation, elevated ferritin (iron storage protein)

Early Life Wildfire Smoke Exposure Is Associated with Immune Dysregulation and Lung Function Decrements in Adolescence (https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1165/rcmb.2016-0380OC)  
Northern California wildfire (summer 2008) adolescent rhesus macaque monkeys housed outdoors
- wildfire smoke generates significant oxidative stress  
- peripheral blood immune cell responses to TLR ligand: IL-6 (in males) and IL-8 protein (in females) amounts decreased  
- "c-Rel and RelB transcription factors in the NF-κB family were significantly reduced in wildfire smoke–exposed female monkeys relative to controls"  
- increased RelB mRNA expression  
- persistent immune function alteration  

Effects of wildfire on sea otter (*Enhydra lutris*) gene transcript profiles (https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/109779/mms12151.pdf?sequence=1)
- increased disease susceptibility  
- immune function suppression  
- increased tranascription of AHR (arylhydrocarbon receptor, responds to toxicants), CaM (calmodulin), HDC (translationally controlled tumor protein)  
- decreased transcription of DRB (MHC component, induces immune response initiation), IL-10 (anti-inflammatory cytokine), IL-18 (pro-inflammatory cytokine)

- Collected wood smoke particles exposed to A549 lung epithelial cells  
- Most important in ROS formation: soot fraction and metals
